OBJECTIVE - Start with a dataset of your choice and perform EDA using libraries like pandas, numpy, and matplotlib or seaborn. Explore the data's characteristics, distributions, correlations, and outliers. Visualize your findings with histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to gain insights into the data.

Dataset Overview Objective: Understand the dataset's structure, size, and content.

Loading the Dataset: Import the dataset using pandas or other data-handling libraries. The dataset could be in formats such as CSV, Excel, or JSON. Initial Inspection: Use functions like .head(), .tail(), and .sample() to preview the data. This helps in familiarizing yourself with the dataset’s layout and content. Dataset Structure: .info(): Provides details about the dataset, including column names, data types, and non-null counts. .shape: Gives the number of rows and columns. 2. Data Characteristics Objective: Summarize key properties of the dataset.

Summary Statistics:

Use .describe() to compute metrics such as mean, median, standard deviation, min, max, and quartiles for numerical columns. Include .value_counts() for categorical columns to understand frequency distributions. Data Types:

Check the data types of each column to ensure compatibility with analysis methods. Missing Values:

Identify missing values using .isnull().sum(). Decide on strategies to handle missing data, such as imputation or removal. 3. Data Distribution Objective: Visualize and understand the spread of data.

Histograms:

Use .hist() or seaborn's sns.histplot() to plot the frequency distribution of numerical variables. This reveals the shape of the distribution (normal, skewed, etc.). Example: Distribution of sales figures over a year. Box Plots:

Use sns.boxplot() to visualize the spread and detect outliers. Example: Box plots of salaries across different departments. Kernel Density Estimation (KDE):

Use sns.kdeplot() to visualize the probability density function of a variable. 4. Relationships Between Variables Objective: Investigate relationships and dependencies between features.

Scatter Plots:

Use matplotlib’s plt.scatter() or seaborn's sns.scatterplot() to examine relationships between two numerical variables. Example: Plotting age vs. income to study trends. Pair Plots:

Use sns.pairplot() to create scatter plots for all variable combinations. It is particularly useful in smaller datasets with fewer variables. 5. Correlation Analysis Objective: Quantify the strength and direction of relationships between numerical variables.

Correlation Matrix:

Use .corr() to compute the correlation coefficients between numerical variables. Values range from -1 (perfect negative correlation) to 1 (perfect positive correlation), with 0 indicating no correlation. Heatmaps:

Visualize the correlation matrix using sns.heatmap() with annotations for better readability. 6. Outlier Detection Objective: Identify extreme values that deviate significantly from other observations.

Box Plots:

Use sns.boxplot() to highlight potential outliers beyond the whiskers of the box. Example: Detecting unusually high property prices in real estate data. Scatter Plots:

Use sns.scatterplot() to detect data points that lie outside the expected range or pattern. Z-Score or IQR Method:

Calculate Z-scores using scipy.stats.zscore() to identify outliers. Use the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to find outliers based on the 1.5 * IQR rule. 7. Data Cleaning Objective: Prepare the dataset by addressing issues identified during EDA.

Handle Missing Values:

Impute missing values using mean, median, or mode for numerical data and the most frequent category for categorical data. Alternatively, drop rows or columns with excessive missing values. Remove Outliers:

Exclude or cap outliers based on the chosen detection method. Transform Data:

Normalize or standardize numerical features for consistency. Encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding or label encoding. 8. Visualization Techniques Objective: Summarize insights using effective visualizations.

Histograms and KDE:

Show the distribution of single variables. Box Plots:

Highlight spread and outliers. Scatter Plots and Pair Plots:

Examine relationships between variables. Heatmaps:

Visualize the correlation matrix for numerical features. Bar Charts and Pie Charts:

Summarize categorical data. 9. Insights and Conclusions Objective: Extract meaningful observations from the EDA process.

Examples of insights:

Patterns: Strong positive correlation between advertising_budget and sales. Outliers: A few extreme values in income that may need capping. Distributions: The age variable is right-skewed, indicating the need for log transformation. Relationships: High correlation between house_size and house_price. Importance of EDA EDA serves multiple purposes, such as:

Understanding the Data: It provides a comprehensive overview of the dataset, revealing trends and anomalies. Feature Selection: Identifies the most relevant features for model building. Problem Identification: Highlights issues like multicollinearity, missing data, and outliers. Hypothesis Validation: Tests initial assumptions or hypotheses about the dataset. EDA lays the groundwork for subsequent data processing, feature engineering, and modeling. By combining statistical analysis with effective visualizations, it transforms raw data into actionable insights.
